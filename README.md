# Portfolio Website 

A modern, high-performance, single-page portfolio website built to showcase skills, projects, and achievements. Designed with a focus on user experience, responsiveness, and visual appeal.

## Project Overview
This project is a full-stack application featuring a decoupled architecture. The frontend delivers a dynamic, interactive user interface, while the backend serves content and handles logic.

### Key Features
-   **Single-Page Architecture**: Smooth scrolling navigation between Home, About, Achievements, Projects, and Socials sections.
-   **Dynamic Content**: All data (profile info, projects, achievements, quotes) is fetched dynamically from the FastAPI backend.
-   **Interactive UI**:
    -   **Skeleton Loading**: Instant visual feedback during data fetching to mitigate cold starts.
    -   **Animations**: Powered by Framer Motion for entrance effects, scroll-triggered reveals, and active state transitions.
    -   **Terminal Component**: A playful, interactive terminal in the About section that reflects the current theme.
    -   **Dark/Light Mode**: Fully supported with persistent state and system preference detection.
-   **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
